# YouTube-Clone
I try creating a YouTube clone with just its interface and some function with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

You can theme to light theme (I create it cuz it's the easiest part about javascript)
You can hover on the video but it won't play any video
You can toggle the sidebar
You can click on the video and it redirect the video index file which I also create with it but it doesn't has any functions, just interface.
